		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>I'm growing Roselle hibiscus in my garden for the first 
time this summer. The calyx at the base of its flowers are dried and used for 
hibiscus tea. Combined with my mint planter, there will be a lot of hibiscus 
and mint combos happening in my kitchen later this year! (Store-bought would 
also be fine.) Now I just need to track down a lemon tree...</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>0.5 cups dried hibiscus calyces</li>
				<li>Handfull torn mint leaves (plus fresh 
leaves for garnish)</li>
				<li>8 cups water, divided</li>
				<li>1 cup fresh-squeezed lemon juice</li>
				<li>1.5 cups granulated sugar<li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Mix hibiscus and mint leaves with 4 cups 
water in a large jar, let steep overnight. (You can also just drink this herbal 
tea mixture after this step!)</li>
				<li>Combine lemon juice, 4 cups water and sugar 
in saucepan, simmer on low heat until mixture is a syrup.</li>
				<li>Strain hibiscus and mint out of tea 
mixture, mix with lemon syrup. Chill.</li>
				<li>Serve over ice, garnish with fresh mint 
leaves if desired.</li>
			</ol>
