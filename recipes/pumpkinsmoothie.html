		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Honestly, I haven't actually tested this recipe, but all of 
the recipes I could find online (in about five minutes of searching...) didn't 
sound all that great. So based on my smoothie-making experience, I'm makiing 
this up a bit as I go. But I imagine this would be pretty great in late 
September when fall feels imminent but the days can still be warm.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>1 cup frozen pumpkin puree (canned is 
fine)</li>
				<li>0.5 frozen banana</li>
				<li>0.5 cups 2% plain Greek yogurt (or 
yogurt of choice)</li>
				<li>0.5 cups 2% lactose-free milk (or milk 
substitute of choice</li>
				<li>1 tsp pumpkin spice blend</li>
				<li>1 tsp crushed ginger (I use the 
pre-portioned cubes from Trader Joe's freezer section)</li>
				<li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Combine ingredients in blender cup.</li>
				<li>Blend on Extract setting. If there are 
still solid bits, blend a second time.</li>
				<li>If desired, garnish with a dollop of 
whipped cream and sprinkle of cinnamon. Enjoy!</li>
			</ol>
